### Purpose
This tool has been written in order to ease the visualization of large GNSS datasets, coming from our various analyses (algorithms, tests, ...).
It converts a .json file, written using our standard convention, into an html containing a marker at each location with a pop-up presenting non-gnss keys found in the input file.
It uses Google Maps as the underlying mapping source.

### Installation
**make** and a **C++11** compatible compiler are required. Clone the repo and type ``make``, it should be enough in most cases!   
There's also a **VS2015** solution avalaible.   
Contains [jsoncons](https://github.com/danielaparker/jsoncons) as a git submodule.

### Usage
```
json_to_html.exe -i input.json -o output.html -m [or] -p
```
where *input.json* must be an existing and valid .json file while *output.html* is the name of the output web page. To select the display mode choose one: *-m* for markers and *-p* for polylines.
